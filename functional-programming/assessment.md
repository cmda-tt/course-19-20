      <td align="center"><strong>Data is rendered with d3</strong>; interpreting the representation is easier that interpreting the data itself</td>
      <td align="center"><strong>A functional pattern is used to clean and transform data. D3 is used to make a dynamic representation</strong></td>

      <td align="center">There is substantial own code; the student can explain the code that exists</td>
      <td align="center">The student can explain some parts of their code, how some parts works together, and some technical choices</td>
      <td align="center">The student can explain every part of their code, how everything works together, and why patters are used instead of alternatives; the project is structured logically</td>
      <td align="center">The project is complex but can easily be understood; alternatives to patterns covered in class was used that were great choices</td>

> **Note**: each of this rubricâ€™s rows is cumulative: for example, to get a 5-6
> on application, you also need to have a 1-2 and 3-4. In addition, each row has to be awarded with a >=5.5 in order to receive a passing grade for this course.
> Bonus points can be rewarded when you've helped fellow students progress. But only if you already have a passing grade.
