# Peer review exercise

## Goal
- Understand the rubric better
- Get feedback on your work
- Help a peer by giving feedback on their work

## Preparation
- [Read the rubric](https://github.com/cmda-tt/course-19-20/blob/master/functional-programming/assessment.md#rubric). Is everything clear?
- Push the latest changes to your readme, code, and wiki
- Pair up in groups of two

## Review

### Repository
- Scan someone else's repository
    + gitignore
    + link to live demo on github pages
    + description
    + concept
    + image
    + link to example used to build visualization (screenshots)
    + data used (what's done with invalid and empty values?)
    + plagiarism and acknowledgements
- Read the wiki, can you follow the datacleaning and transforming process?
  + Is the update pattern (data flow) documented?

### Concept

- Does the visualization makes sense on it's own? (labels, axis, titles)
- What patterns do you see in this visualization. What can a user (viewer) learn? 
- Is the visualization build for a target audience? (write in issue)
- How does the data change based on interaction (hide show svg's, data filtering?)


### Code

- Read the code
    + try to understand the code flow
    + Do you see any improvements? (is it functional, consistency, reusability, naming conventions etc.)
- Assess assignment according to rubric (If you cant assess something, write in an issue why)
- Write your feedback in issues on their repo (separate issue for each thing)
- Positive feedback is also welcome and can be put into an issue


## Closure
- Review the issues that were created for your own repo. Ask your peer about them if you don't understand.
- Respond to the issues with an action (for instance: valid point, will fix)
- Close relevant issues before the assessment by solving them.
