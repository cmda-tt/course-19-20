# D3 examples

## Loading data 𝌗
This is a very basic example demonstrating how to do this. Make sure you understand promises and scope.

## Databinding 🔄
This is a basic example that doesn't use scales

## Worldmap with modules and nested data 🐣
This example uses modules to keep the main code file clean. The modules can be reused in other projects.
It also uses nested data so we can target each of the countries in our data separately.
It's still a WIP and subject to change.

## Working with time ⌚️
Times can be tough, that's why I wrote this article explaing how to work with time in d3 :)

## Interactive barchart through update loop - y-axis 📊
In this visualization, the data that's rendered in the view changes because of user interaction

## Interactive barchart through update loop - both axes 🎩
An improved version of the previous barchart where both axes update!
This one needs to use enter and exit in the update function becaus the number of bars changes.
