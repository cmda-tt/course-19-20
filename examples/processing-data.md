# Processing data

This example shows how to:
- Load a csv file using the fs module
- Convert the csv to json using d3
- Match data based on a pattern
- Clean and transform data
- Detect and obfuscate geolocations (this is quite specific code but might be usefull to look through anyway)
- Store data in a json file

This code is stored in a [separate repo here](https://github.com/Razpudding/preprocessing-survey) and will only work if you follow the install steps.
