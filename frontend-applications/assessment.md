## Description

Assessment 1 tests your skills for [**frontend applications**][fa].

> **Note**: your project must be a repository on GitHub named `frontend-applications`.

We will download and archive your project when it’s due.

## Assignment

Create a client-side application in JavaScript which dynamically renders data to views using either a front-end framework or system created by you.
Reflect on the merits and costs of frameworks together.

## Goals

This assessment focusses on [goal 1][g1] (**learn how to create with
libraries**), [subgoal 9][s9] (**use libraries**), [subgoal 1][s1] (**read docs**), [subgoal 2][s2] (**write docs**),
[subgoal 5][s5] (**manipulate elements**), and [subgoal 6][s6] (**load external
data**).

      <td align="center">Git and npm are used; the project runs without errors; data is loaded; there is a view that represents the data</td>
      <td align="center"><strong>Views are rendered dynamically from data</strong>; interpreting the representation is easier that interpreting the raw data itself</td>
      <td align="center"><strong>Data can be read and changed; changes to data are reflected in the interface; changes persist across page reloads</strong></td>
      <td align="center">Views go beyond an example or tutorial: there are demonstrable additions <strong>like routing or creating data</strong></td>
      <td align="center">😱<br>The way the student applies subject matter is more advanced than what they were taught in class; let’s switch places</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th align="center" scope="row">Understanding</th>
      <td align="center">There is substantial own code and the student can eplain how the project was created</td>
      <td align="center">The student can explain some parts of their code, how some parts works together, and some technical choices</td>
      <td align="center">The student can explain every part of their code; the project is structured logically. The student can explain the merits of frameworks inr elation to their project</td>
      <td align="center">The project is complex but can easily be understood; student used or wrote code not covered in class that was carefully chosen while weighing alternatives</td>
      <td align="center">🤓<br>The student deeply understands their code and a geeky / nerdy conversation can be held about this</td>

      <td align="center">The project is handed in on time, working, documented, and on GitHub</td>
      <td align="center">Code style is consistent; code and project  are partially documented</td>
      <td align="center">Code adheres to standards; docs cover what the project is and does</td>
      <td align="center">Code quality is good and enforced; docs are useful and professional</td>
      <td align="center">📚<br>Code and docs both read like great books</td>

      <th align="center" scope="row">Process</th>
      <td align="center">Process is partially documented</td>
      <td align="center">Process is properly documented</td>
      <td align="center">Choices are evaluated and documented; progress is demonstrated</td>
      <td align="center">Significant progress or iterations are demonstrated</td>
